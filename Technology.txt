Problem:
Traditional forest management methods rely on manual surveys, which are time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes ineffective in detecting illegal activities like logging or forest fires early.

Solution:
Deploy AI-powered drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and thermal sensors to monitor forests in real time.

How It Works:
Aerial Surveillance: Drones fly over the forest, capturing images and videos.
AI Analysis: Machine learning algorithms analyze the footage to detect deforestation, wildlife movement, and signs of disease.
Fire Prevention: Thermal cameras detect heat anomalies, allowing early intervention before wildfires spread.
Illegal Logging Detection: AI identifies unauthorized tree cutting, alerting forest rangers immediately.
Data Integration: The system integrates with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for precise mapping and long-term forest health analysis.
Benefits:
✔ Faster and more efficient forest monitoring
✔ Reduces human labor and costs
✔ Provides real-time data for quick decision-making
✔ Helps in conservation and prevents illegal activities
